## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Environment Setup

- [ ] **Copy production environment template**
  ```bash
  cp .env.production.example .env.production
  ```

- [ ] **Generate production JWT secret**
  ```bash
  node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex'))"
  ```

- [ ] **Configure production environment variables:**
  - [ ] `DATABASE_URL` (Supabase)
  - [ ] `DIRECT_URL` (Supabase)
  - [ ] `JWT_SECRET` (unique for production)
  - [ ] `FRONTEND_URL` (your production domain)
  - [ ] Contract addresses (already deployed)

### Step 2: Database

- [ ] **Run migrations on production database**
  ```bash
  npx prisma migrate deploy
  ```

- [ ] **Verify schema**
  ```bash
  npx prisma db pull
  ```

- [ ] **Seed demo data (optional)**
  ```bash
  npm run db:seed
  ```

- [ ] **Enable connection pooling** (Supabase dashboard)

- [ ] **Configure daily backups** (Supabase dashboard)

### Step 3: Backend Deployment

Choose your platform and follow [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md):

**Option 1: Railway (Recommended)**
- [ ] Create Railway project
- [ ] Connect GitHub repository
- [ ] Configure environment variables
- [ ] Deploy backend service
- [ ] Verify health endpoint: `/health`
- [ ] Test API endpoints

**Option 2: Render**
- [ ] Create Render account
- [ ] Deploy as Web Service
- [ ] Configure environment
- [ ] Verify deployment

**Option 3: AWS/Docker**
- [ ] Build Docker image
- [ ] Push to container registry
- [ ] Deploy to ECS/EC2
- [ ] Configure load balancer

### Step 4: Frontend Deployment

**Option 1: Vercel (Recommended)**
- [ ] Import GitHub repository
- [ ] Configure environment variables
- [ ] Deploy frontend
- [ ] Verify build succeeds
- [ ] Test application

**Option 2: Render/AWS**
- [ ] Follow deployment guide
- [ ] Configure CDN
- [ ] Enable HTTPS

### Step 5: Domain & SSL

- [ ] **Purchase domain** (optional)
  - Namecheap
  - Google Domains
  - Cloudflare Registrar

- [ ] **Configure DNS:**
  - [ ] Point domain to frontend (A/CNAME record)
  - [ ] Point `api.` subdomain to backend (CNAME record)

- [ ] **Enable HTTPS/SSL:**
  - [ ] Vercel auto-provisions SSL
  - [ ] Railway auto-provisions SSL
  - [ ] For custom: Let's Encrypt/Cloudflare

- [ ] **Update environment variables with new URLs:**
  - [ ] Backend: `FRONTEND_URL=https://yourdomain.com`
  - [ ] Frontend: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com`

### Step 6: Security

- [ ] **CORS configuration:**
  - [ ] Whitelist only production frontend domain
  - [ ] Remove wildcard `*` origins

- [ ] **Rate limiting:**
  - [ ] Implement on critical endpoints
  - [ ] `/api/auth/login` - 5 req/min
  - [ ] `/api/auth/register` - 3 req/min
  - [ ] `/api/products` - 60 req/min

- [ ] **Environment secrets:**
  - [ ] Rotate all secrets from development
  - [ ] Use different JWT_SECRET
  - [ ] Never commit `.env.production`

- [ ] **Database security:**
  - [ ] Enable Supabase Row Level Security (RLS)
  - [ ] Whitelist production server IPs
  - [ ] Enable connection pooling

- [ ] **DDoS protection:**
  - [ ] Enable Cloudflare (recommended)
  - [ ] Configure firewall rules

### Step 7: Monitoring & Error Tracking

- [ ] **Set up Sentry (optional but recommended):**
  - [ ] Create Sentry projects (backend + frontend)
  - [ ] Add `SENTRY_DSN` to environment
  - [ ] Test error reporting
  - [ ] Configure alerts

- [ ] **Set up UptimeRobot:**
  - [ ] Monitor `/health` endpoint (every 5 min)
  - [ ] Monitor frontend homepage
  - [ ] Configure email/SMS alerts

- [ ] **Log aggregation:**
  - [ ] Railway logs (built-in)
  - [ ] Or LogDNA/Papertrail
  - [ ] Set up log retention (30 days)

- [ ] **Performance monitoring:**
  - [ ] Sentry performance
  - [ ] Or New Relic/DataDog
  - [ ] Set baseline metrics

### Step 8: Testing Production

- [ ] **Health checks:**
  - [ ] Backend: `https://api.yourdomain.com/health` returns 200
  - [ ] Frontend: `https://yourdomain.com` loads

- [ ] **User flows:**
  - [ ] Register new account
  - [ ] Login with credentials
  - [ ] Connect MetaMask wallet
  - [ ] Register a product
  - [ ] Add checkpoint
  - [ ] Verify product authenticity
  - [ ] Check real-time WebSocket updates

- [ ] **Blockchain integration:**
  - [ ] MetaMask connects to Sepolia
  - [ ] Product registration writes to blockchain
  - [ ] Transaction hash saved to database
  - [ ] View transaction on Etherscan

- [ ] **Cross-browser testing:**
  - [ ] Chrome
  - [ ] Firefox
  - [ ] Safari
  - [ ] Edge

- [ ] **Mobile testing:**
  - [ ] iOS Safari
  - [ ] Android Chrome

### Step 9: Documentation

- [ ] **Update README.md:**
  - [ ] Add production URL
  - [ ] Update demo links
  - [ ] Add deployment badges

- [ ] **Create demo video:**
  - [ ] Record walkthrough (5 min)
  - [ ] Upload to YouTube
  - [ ] Add link to README

- [ ] **Create slides:**
  - [ ] Project overview
  - [ ] Architecture
  - [ ] Demo screenshots
  - [ ] Hackathon submission

- [ ] **User guide:**
